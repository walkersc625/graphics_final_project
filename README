Texture Synthesis Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build instructions:

mkdir results
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
bin/texture


Running instructions:

First, you will be prompted to provide a sample texture to synthesize from. We
have included several textures in the assets/ folder, but any square image
file will work. Smaller texture samples will run faster, so we recommend using
the textures in the assets/tiny/ directory.

Next, you can input your parameters, such as patch size and the amount of
texture to synthesize, using the GUI. We recommend using a small patch size
for speed (15 or less), and a relatively small output size. You also have the
option to use the whole image or a random patch as a starting seed, and to
synthesize starting from the center or from the top left corner.

If you would like to save the results, you can add an output filename. On
closing, the file will be saved in the results/ directory in whatever format
is implied by the file extension. To close the program "correctly" (so that it
saves the image), close one of the windows displaying an image.
