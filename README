Texture Synthesis Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build instructions:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
bin/texture


Running instructions:

First, you will be prompted to provide a sample texture to synthesize from. We have
included several textures in the assets/ folder, but any square image file
will work. We recommend using the textures in assets/tiny, because these are
much smaller and will run much faster.

Next, you can input your parameters using the GUI. We recommend using a small
patch size for speed (15 or less), and a relatively small output size. You
also have the option to use the whole image or a random patch as a starting
seed, and to synthesize starting from the center or from the top left corner.

If you would like to save the results, you can add an output filename. The file will
be saved upon closing in the results/ directory in whatever format is implied by the file
extension. We have also included some sample results in this folder.
